FEEDBACK:

Well done!


Good implementation of the class Subsetsum findSubset() method.

Very good stress testing of your code.


-0 Incomplete return type in class SubsetSum findSubset() method resulting in compiler error:
Type mismatch: cannot convert from ArrayList<capture#1-of ?> to ArrayList<Double>
   Recall that the goal of using generics is to avoid casting.
   Instead of:
       public static ArrayList<?> findSubset(ArrayList<?> list, double budget)
   Consider parameterizing it with a type:
   		public static <T> ArrayList<T> findSubset(ArrayList<T> list, double budget) {
   
   Take a look at the following Java documentation on Wildcards:
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/wildcards.html
 

Extra Credit Opportunity:
+2 implementation of findSubset() for SongEntry type.

+2 clearly defined test cases for findSubset() method.   
  
-Bita.
